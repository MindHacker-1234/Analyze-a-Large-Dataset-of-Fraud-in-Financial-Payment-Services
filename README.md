# Analyze-a-Large-Dataset-of-Fraud-in-Financial-Payment-Services
I analyzed a recently acquired dataset of mobile money transactions from a financial services provider. Let’s go into a bit more detail about the database before we start.

The dataset has five types of transactions:

CASH-IN is any deposit.
CASH-OUT is any withdrawal.
DEBIT is a specific type of withdrawal in which the money is sent to the user’s bank account.
PAYMENT is the purchase of goods or services. 
TRANSFER involves moving money from one user’s account to another user’s account 

There are two fields related to fraud tagging. IsFlaggedFraud is fraud detected by their automation system while IsFraud is fraud that truly occurred
